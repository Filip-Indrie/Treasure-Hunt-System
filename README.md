# Treasure Hunt System (UNIX, C)

This project is a multi-phase UNIX systems programming application written in C that simulates a digital treasure hunt platform. It focuses on low-level OS concepts such as file systems, processes, signals, pipes, and inter-process communication.

The system is composed of multiple programs that allow users to create and manage treasure hunts, monitor game state using background processes, and compute user scores via external programs and pipes.

The implementation was developed incrementally across three phases, each phase building upon the previous one.

For a complete specification, design details and functionality description, please refer to `SO_SO1_OS Project Phase 1, 2, and 3.pdf`.

## Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> ### This project was made for Linux based operating systems only!  
> ### You must have bash and gcc installed to be able to compile the project!

Run the following command to compile all the necessary files:
```
./compile.sh <EXECUTABLE_NAME>
```

EXECUTABLE_NAME = the name of the resulted executable
